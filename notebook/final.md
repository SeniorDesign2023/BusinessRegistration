A synopsis of your project goal(s) [15 pt] 

    For our project, our goal was to build a website that would act as a centralized location to fill out forms from different organizations. This included the ability to create, find and manage organizations, and create, fill, submit, and manage forms.

Finalized Plan of Work (including expected vs actual) 

    Expected plan: Our original plan was to create a form filling tool for the State of Wyoming but that fell through so we transitioned to creating a general purpose form filling tool. We want this tools to allow you to join ‘Organizations’ and you would be able to see forms from that organization. We also wanted the forms to autocomplete and create a GUI for form building.  

    We ended up making the GUI form builder to a stretch goal, due the amount of time it would take to implement.  

 

Summary of Final Implementation: [40 pt] 
      

    Design: For our final design (front-end design) we aimed to create a platform that was similar to popular document editing software like Quip. In this way, we hoped it would be easy to navigate and easy for users as well. Our overall design had various iterations with the final iteration focusing mainly on user interaction with the use of icons, design changes based on interactions, as well as a warm color palette. We also focused on making the design appropriate for all the features we planned on including so that functionalities like those of the admin and form views could easily be found and navigated.  

Limitations: We had some limitations with the use of Next-JS which made navigation to pages not as smooth as the pages had to be refreshed for the contents to be appropriately arranged.  

    Future Direction: This project can be revised to have a more user-friendly form creation. Creating a graphical user interface as opposed to inputting a JSON schema to create a form will make it much easier for admins to create forms. Another feature that could be added is the ability to send out links for users to join organizations, this way it is a more secure method to join an organization.  

Statement of Work  

Whole Team 

    Created a fully functional web app including frontend, backend, and database that will bring forms from multiple organizations into one place. The app includes an automated form filling system and admin tools for managing form assignments and responses. 

1 per  team member 

    Fortune Nwokejiobi: For this project, I focused mainly on the front-end design by creating the different pages of the website, designing those pages, and managing navigation through these pages.  

    Lucas Eifert: Designed and implemented a MySQL database to hold user profiles, organizations, forms, membership and form assignment.  Integrated the app back-end with database for profile, create organization, a dynamically loading organization sidebar, and admin pages.

Reflection on your team's ability to design, implement, and evaluate a solution. [20 pt] 
      

Lessons Learned: 

    Value of feedback: It was essential in the front-end design process to receive feedback to make the website much more user-friendly for general users rather than understandable just for group members. 

    Spend time discussing implementation before starting to write code. This caused us to write Mutiple copies of the same code for implementing different features, which wasted time.  

"If you had to do it all over again" 

    Time management: If this process were to be redone, I believe more emphasis could have been placed on time management and ensuring that we were able to finish our minimum-viable product during the earlier part of the semester so that way we could have added some other functionalities. 

Advice for future teams 

        Start writing code early (Before Christmas break even).  Cleary define goals for what needs to be completed and by when and stick to it. Set regular weekly meeting times to work as a group, discuss problems, and future goals; make it clear who is doing what each week. Communicate with your team members.
