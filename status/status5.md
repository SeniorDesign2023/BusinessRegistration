    Recap of what was planned for the last 3 weeks 

Our plan for the previous 3 weeks was to continue work on integrating the database with the website backend and to work on refine the design of the frontend to make it more usable and visually appealing.  

    Tasks completed  

    Description of tasks completed (and by whom) 

 

Lucas – Modified database to use a Tag system for primary keys in the Organization table and completed the backend of CreateOrg page. Started work on the backend for view/edit profile page to integrate with DB.  

Miles – Got form uploads and rendering working. Filled forms are now stored in the database. 

Fortune – added front-end implementations for the admin functionalities and improved the front-end design by adding icons. Also added functionality for much smoother navigation.

    Successes  

    What were your group accomplishments? 

We have continued to work on the backend of the website. We have finished integrating the login/signup system, the create organization page, and the form filler. We have also been able to fully highlight all the functionality we will need, including things like how the admin will be able to do certain functionalities.  

    What solutions were successful? 

We encounter a different bug where the site would sometimes not redirect after clicking a button. This was solved by deleting the .next folder and recompiling the app.  

    Were there other things you tried that did not work and why? 

In an attempt to identify the source of the rendering problems, we tried disabling global style sheet different redirect methods, and upgrading and downgrading Next.js.  

    Roadblocks/challenges  

    Describe the challenges 

We are encountering a rendering bug where some elements are rendering to the right of where they should be until we refresh the page. We also encountered several small integration bugs where the database in the backend did not work together.  

    Did you overcome them or are there still challenges left? 

We were able to modify the database to work better with the back. We are still working on a fix to the rendering issue.  

    Do you need help with it? Can your mentor help or do you need external help? 

We have spoken with our instructor about this issue. We will continue to investigate the issue ourselves and we will look into online resources.  

    Changes/Deviations from the project Pitch 

We officially decided to not create a GUI form building tool, as we will likely not have time to complete it. Instead, we will just have implemented a text box to paste in formatted JSON that can be interpreted later.  

    Confidence on completion of the project for each team member and the group average
