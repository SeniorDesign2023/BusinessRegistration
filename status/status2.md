Recap of what was planned for the last 3 weeks 
    We planned to continue working with the State of Wyoming to modernize their business registration portal. After a meeting with a member of the senate office, we found out that our project idea was going to be done by someone else, so we decided to pivot to a new idea. This involved considering various other ideas the state of Wyoming proposed, group members proposing new ideas, or continuing with a website that used the concepts we wanted to work on with the State of Wyoming.  

	Our group was able to decide on a new idea which was a centralized website that allows users to fill out forms from different organizations. The goal of this project is to allow users to easily access forms from different organizations they are connected to, without the issue of worrying about where forms to be filled are located and keeping track of forms submitted.  

    After our group was able to nail down our new idea, we were able to meet to discuss more specific parts of the project like user interface, technologies to be used, and various components the website will have.  

Tasks completed  
    Description of tasks completed (and by whom) 
        Lucas – Started creating basic diagrams for database design 
        Miles – compiling use cases for final planning document 
        Group:  decided on what parts of the project we can finish by the end of the project and the parts that can be left as stretch goals 
        
Successes  
    What were your group accomplishments? 
        Finalizing on a new idea to pivot to: We were able to decide on a new idea we wanted to work with after the business registration platform for Wyoming did not work out. 

        Agreeing on technologies to use for the project: as a group, we were able to research different technologies to use. This involved things like deciding on what programming language we would work with, frameworks to use, and the database we would be using, 

        Divided the project for each member of the group: we were able to divide the workload into the front-end, back-end, and database and assigned each part to each team member. 

    Were there other things you tried that did not work and why? 
        We tried considering other projects that the senator’s office was working on: After we found out that the business registration page with the state was not going to work out, we considered the various ideas we heard from the senate’s office. After a discussion with our team to see whether we wanted to take it on we decided not to.   

        A video form filler: This idea was proposed but involved more complexity than what was originally intended, and the group wanted to maintain the previous idea of a form website that allowed text fields.  

Roadblocks/challenges  
    Describe the challenges 
        Upon meeting with someone from the Wyoming secretary of state's office, they told us the website redesign had already been given to another company. They did present a couple other projects they were interested in however these projects did not align with our skillsets. 

    Did you overcome them or are there still challenges left? 
        We overcame this challenge by deciding to move away from working with the State and to complete our own version of the project. This will give us more flexibility in terms and design and timeline to complete the project. 

 
    Do you need help with it?  Can your mentor help or do you need external help? 
        We should be able to complete most of this project on our own. As we get into devolpment, out menotr should be able to help with our questions. Later on if we decide to host this project, we may need help in finding what the best options are.
 
Changes/Deviations from the project Pitch 
    We have moved away from working with the state of Wyoming. We have decided to make a generic version of the project we were going to do from them with the addition of automatic form filling and centralizing forms from many companies in one place. 

Confidence on completion of the project for each team member and the group average  
    Scale of 1-5; 1 not-confident; 3 = toss-up; 5 = confident. 
        Lucas - 4 
        Fortune: 4 
        Miles - 4 
        Group average - 4 

Group dynamics  
    Is your group working or are there problems? 
        So far, we have been able to decide on a time we can meet as a group each week. Also, the group was able to agree on certain aspects of the project like the technologies we will use and how we can assign tasks.
