- **Recap** of what was planned for the last 3 weeks
  - For the last three weeks, we followed the tasks assigned in our planning chart. Our work was split up into three parts
    - Front-end: Set up initial configuration. Finish Front-end design. Start with Front-end implementation.
    - Backend: Finalize JSON schema for data exchange with frontend, create login system
    - Database: Find a way to host a database using localhost and build tables.
- **Tasks Completed** What was done during the last 3 weeks (by whom) :

1. Description of tasks completed

Front-end (Fortune Nwokejiobi) -

  - Created the initial configuration.
  - Created the front-end design with Figma. This showcased the pages the website will have and their basic interactions.
  - Started with the front-end implementation.

Database (Lucas): Created a Vagrant Box with phpMyAdmin that runs on Virutal Box for database design work and began creating tables.

Backend (Miles): Found existing JSON schema for use with the form engine which supports automatically filling in data; determined two viable options for directing data to the appropriate part of the database; created credential checking system

1. Your choice of quantifiable metric(s)
(e.g., hours, lines of code, meeting count, doc/test coverage %,...)
  1. The whole group helped with the initial configuration: 1 hour 30 minutes
  2. Front-end design: 5 hours
  3. Front –end implementation: 2 hours
  4. Database VM Setup – 2 hours
  5. Start of creating tables – 1 hour
  6. Determining JSON schema – 1.5 hours
  7. Creating credential system – 2 hours

- **Successes**

1. What are your accomplishments?

Created a user-friendly front-end mockup of the site. We got the database set up to work with localhost.

1. What solutions were successful?

Using a tool to create a mock-up of the website design was successful because it allowed us to quickly make changes to the design before writing code.

1. Were there other things that you tried that did not work and why?

- Note in final summary discuss where your project could go from here)

- **Confidence** on completion from each team member + team average [5 pts]
Scale of 1-5; 1 = not-confident; 3 = toss-up; 5 = confident
