Recap of what was planned for the last 3 weeks 

Our plan for the previous 3 weeks was to finish everything. More specifically, we needed to continue fine tuning the front end. Finish integrating the database with the front-end pages and admin pages. Implement dynamic form loading and implement autofilling of forms.

Successes  
What were your group accomplishments? 

Our biggest success is that we managed to complete our minimum viable product outlined in the final planning document.  

What solutions were successful? 

We encountered some navigation bugs in the admin pages where the current selected organization was forgot when navigating back from form responses or assignment to the admin main page, we were able to resolve this by changing the method the next router used to navigate between pages.  

Were there other things you tried that did not work and why? 

We again spent some time trying to resolve the rendering issues, but we were unable to resolve the problem. We decided that our time was better spent finishing other parts of the project and working on the presentation.  

Roadblocks/challenges  
Describe the challenges 

Due to time constraints and complexity, we were unable to implement a good search function for joining public organizations. We instead implemented a simple search that does not update options as they are entered.  

Did you overcome them or are there still challenges left? 

We were unable to fix the rendering bug caused by Next.js, however, we were able to identify the the cause of the issue. We believe the rendering issues are being caused by css not loading in time or loading in the incorrect order. 

Do you need help with it? Can your mentor help or do you need external help? 

We do not need any assistance with this part of our project.  

Changes/Deviations from the project Pitch 

We have not made any deviations from the pitch that have not been outlined in previous status updates.
