    Answer the 4 following questions about your project.  You may likely have some of this in the status messages.  

What went well? 

    We were able to meet with the Wyoming secretary of state's office and have a discussion with them regarding the project they need. After working with the state fell through, we were able to build a plan for our own version of the project.  

 

What didn't go so well? 

    Our initial decision to work with the Wyoming Secretary of State’s office did not end up working out. After meeting with them we learned that they had already selected a company to revamp the website. They did present a few ideas for other projects they needed in the meantime, but they did not align with our skillset. We decided to go in our own direction and build our own form filing website.  

 

What have we learned? 

    Before we changed our project idea, we learned that working with an external company was difficult due to the slow communication. Additionally, we learned that matching the timeline for this class with the timeline the state had in mind would be difficult. After moving to our own version of the project, we learned that building an intuitive user interface will be difficult. We had several meetings where we discussed how a user will interact with the site, how forms will be presented, and how they will be able to be accessed on the admin side. We are prepared to make modifications to our plan later in the project if necessary.  

 

What are still issues/problems/puzzles? 

    We have planned out most of the project so far, but we still do not have a concrete plan for how we will implement the interpreter that will take JSON from the database and convert it into the html elements that will be displayed on the site. Also, while we do have a general idea for how the user will navigate our site, we have not decided on the design for our front end. We plan on creating an initial design next semester and tweak it as we go along. 

  

What recommendations would you make for Senior design 1 for next fall?  (The is not an evaluation of Jim or Lars, just about the class structure). 

What went well and worked and should be continued? 

    Having periodic assignments like the planning documents and status updates was helpful for keeping the project moving.   

What didn't go so well and should be changed? 

    The classes felt a bit pointless once groups were established; we were simply restating parts of a paper we had already submitted, occasionally answering a professor’s question, then going home. The class should facilitate more interaction between the groups, i.e. being designed around facilitating questions from other groups, which there simply was not enough time for in the current format.
