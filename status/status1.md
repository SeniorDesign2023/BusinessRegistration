Recap of what was planned for the last 3 weeks 
    Contact the Secretary of State's office to schedule an appointment to discuss what requirements they would need from this web app.

Tasks completed  
Description of tasks completed (and by whom) 
    Miles reached out to Senator Rothfuss, he contacted Colin with the Secretary of State’s office and proposed a Zoom meeting. 

Successes  
    What were you group accomplishments? 
        We started the conversation with the Secretary of State’s office to discuss what features they need on the website.   

    Were there other things you tried that did not work and why? 
        At this point in the project, we have not had any setbacks.  

Roadblocks/challenges  
    Describe the challenges 
        Getting in contact with multiple third parties, especially Colin with whom we do not have direct contact yet 

    Did you overcome them or are there still challenges left? 
        We are still waiting for a response, ideally once contact is established it should be easier to maintain 

    Do you need help with it? Can your mentor help or do you need external help? 
        We need help with finding webhosting(does the department have any options or do we need to use a service like AWS) and recommendations for a webserver, or if we even need it.  

Changes/Deviations from the project Pitch 
    Possible – if it proves too difficult to contact the Secretary of State’s office, we may need to complete our vision for the project without considering their actual needs. 

Confidence on completion of the project for each team member and the group average  
    Scale of 1-5; 1 not-confident; 3 = toss-up; 5 = confident.
